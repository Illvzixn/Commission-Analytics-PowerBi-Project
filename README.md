🧠 Insights & Recommendations
📉 1. Underperformance in Quota Attainment
•	Some reps consistently achieve less than 70% of their quota.
•	Consider coaching, redistribution of territories, or review of quota fairness.
💰 2. Low Average Commission Rate in Certain Products
•	If reps are earning lower commissions from certain products, it may discourage pushing those products.
•	Consider raising commission rates for high-margin but low-sales-volume products.
🎯 3. Uneven Monthly Performance
•	Sales and commissions may peak in certain months (e.g., Q4).
•	Consider running quarterly bonuses or monthly SPIFs to balance revenue throughout the year.
📊 4. Commission Cost vs. Revenue Alignment
•	Some reps may be earning high commissions while underperforming in revenue.
•	Set a floor quota before commission kicks in (e.g., 60% attainment) to control costs.
